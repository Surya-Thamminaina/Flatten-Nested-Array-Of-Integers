# Flatten-Nested-Array-Of-Integers

## About

This is a very small SBT application which contains a single function and its unit test suite as well as auto generated property based test suite.


### Note

- Since this does not have anything to run with, I did not create any extra code to run and validate
- However, all the test cases can be run on the project which basically takes care of the testing part


## Prerequisite

This application requires SBT as a prerequisite.


## How to test

- Download (and extract)/ Clone this project to your local
- Goto root directory of the project
- Start SBT. ```sbt```
- Then, to run all tests, run the command `test`. That's it.


Thanks!
